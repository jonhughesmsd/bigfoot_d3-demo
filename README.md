A visual representation of bigfoot sightings in the US using D3.

The data was sanitized with Python, using the pandas and numpy libraries.

Each data point on the map represents a reported bigfoot-related sighting. The color of the dots represents the classification of the sighting. The data can be filtered by classification using the checkboxes on the right and by year using the histogram below the map.

Hovering over a dot gives displays on brief information on the sighting below the title on the right side of the screen. Click on a dot displays more detailed information below.
